# Twisty

Twisty is a vector database written from scratch in pure typescript. Currently it isn't really much of anything but it is a kind of playground for me to learn about and implement various various Vector similarity algorithims such as Annoy (a tree based algorithm created at spotify) and HNSW (a graph based algorithm). Right now it only has KNN or brute force implemented.
